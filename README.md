# Digital Signal Processing MATLAB Files

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB files created throughout my electrical engineering degree. These files serve as demonstrations and implementations of various digital signal processing (DSP) concepts. Each MATLAB script or function is designed to illustrate specific DSP techniques, algorithms, or theories, aiding in understanding and practical application.

## Background

As part of my journey through the electrical engineering program, I've accumulated practical knowledge and hands-on experience in digital signal processing. These MATLAB files were developed during coursework, personal projects, or as experiments to explore and solidify DSP principles.

## File Descriptions

The repository includes MATLAB scripts and functions covering a variety of digital signal processing topics. Some of the key concepts and implementations showcased in these files are:
- Filters (Butterworth, Chebyshev, FIR, IIR)
- Fourier Transform and Frequency Analysis
- Convolution and Correlation
- Signal Sampling and Reconstruction
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Windowing Techniques
- Spectral Analysis
- Modulation Techniques (AM, FM, PM)
- Signal Processing in the Time and Frequency Domains

The files are organized according to their respective topics, each accompanied by a brief description to explain their purpose and functionality.
